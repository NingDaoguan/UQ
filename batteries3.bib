abstract ={For the research, development, and eventual manufacture of lithium?ion batteries, it is necessary to understand the phenomena limting cell performance and incorporate this knowledge into battery design. While methods exist for the determination of electrolyte?phase properties, procedures for the assessment of analogous solid?state properties in battery electrode materials are more difficult to implement. The perturbation solution derived in this work is implemented to determine the intercalate diffusion coefficient in a solvent?cast porous electrode containing carbonized poly(acrylonitrile) fibers suitable for a lithium?ion battery. It is shown that both intercalate and vacant site contributions to the excess free energy of the solid phase influence significantly the nonequilibrium behavior of the electrode. In addition, the analysis is shown to provide insight into the processes that govern the pulse?power performance of batteries based on insertion electrodes (e.g., lithium?ion and metal?hydride batteries). © 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

abstract ={The compositional variations of the thermodynamic and mass transport properties of the ? phase 

 in the lithium?aluminum system have been investigated over the temperature range from 415¡ to 600¡C. At 415¡C, the emf of the single phase 

 lies between 300 and 70 mV relative to pure Li and this corresponds to a Li activity increasing from 0.0063 to 0.31 over the phase stability range from 46.8 to 55.0 atomic percent Li. At the ideal stoichiometry, the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of 

 is ?29.2 kJ/mole at 415¡C and the corresponding enthalpy and entropy are ?43.3 kJ/mole and ?20.6 J/mole ¡K, respectively. Two different electrochemical transient techniques have been used to measure the chemical diffusion coefficient in 

 as a function of the stoichiometry; the experimental results obtained are in good agreement. On the lithium deficit side of the ideal stoichiometry, the chemical diffusion coefficient increases with decreasing Li concentration, becoming about 10?4 cm2/sec near the phase boundary. On the other hand, it is composition independent on the Li excess side of 

varying with temperature from

abstract ={Every mathematical model of a battery has one or more  parameters, which need to be obtained from experimental data.   However, most models do not allow for the fact that the  estimated parameter values have a factor of uncertainty  associated with them - that may originate from non-uniformities  in the material property or the scatter in the experimental  data among other factors.  In the present work, a generalized  procedure to incorporate uncertainty in parameter values based  on the Polynomial Chaos Theory (PCT) is presented. The particle  size inside the carbon electrode of a lithium ion cell is  assumed to have a Gaussian distribution of a known mean and  standard deviation.  The effect of this distributed parameter  value on the discharge curve is illustrated as an example.},
