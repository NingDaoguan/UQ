doi = {10.1149/1.1393627}, 
abstract ={A mathematical model is developed to describe the impedance response of a porous electrode composed of spherical intercalation particles. The model considers a porous electrode without solution?phase diffusion limitations. The model is developed by first deriving the impedance response of a single intercalation particle, obtained by solving a set of governing equations which describe charge?transfer and double?layer charging at the surface, solid?phase diffusion inside the particle, and an open?circuit potential which varies as a function of intercalant concentration. The model also considers the effect of an insulating film surrounding the particle. The governing equations are linearized to take advantage of the small amplitude of the perturbing current in impedance analysis. Once the impedance of a single particle is determined, this result is incorporated into a model which describes a porous electrode limited by ohmic drop in the solution and solid phases, and by the impedance of the particles of which the porous electrode is composed. The model can be used to examine the effect of physical properties and particle?size distributions in the porous electrode, and the usefulness of impedance analysis to measure solid?phase diffusion coefficients is scrutinized. © 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

abstract ={For the research, development, and eventual manufacture of lithium?ion batteries, it is necessary to understand the phenomena limting cell performance and incorporate this knowledge into battery design. While methods exist for the determination of electrolyte?phase properties, procedures for the assessment of analogous solid?state properties in battery electrode materials are more difficult to implement. The perturbation solution derived in this work is implemented to determine the intercalate diffusion coefficient in a solvent?cast porous electrode containing carbonized poly(acrylonitrile) fibers suitable for a lithium?ion battery. It is shown that both intercalate and vacant site contributions to the excess free energy of the solid phase influence significantly the nonequilibrium behavior of the electrode. In addition, the analysis is shown to provide insight into the processes that govern the pulse?power performance of batteries based on insertion electrodes (e.g., lithium?ion and metal?hydride batteries). © 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

 as a function of the stoichiometry; the experimental results obtained are in good agreement. On the lithium deficit side of the ideal stoichiometry, the chemical diffusion coefficient increases with decreasing Li concentration, becoming about 10?4 cm2/sec near the phase boundary.

abstract ={A fully parameterized microscale model for lithium ion cells is presented in which the solid and pores (filled by electrolyte) are spatially resolved, and the mass and charge transport equations describing diffusion and migration in each phase are solved separately. Such a model allows: (1) the correlation of structure-scale, non-homogeneous material properties with macroscopic battery performance, and (2) the correlation of geometrical electrode morphology with macroscopic battery performance (electrode design). The micro-model approach discussed here allows for a simpler parameterization as fewer constitutive relations are needed in contrast to the macro-homogenous physical-based approaches. Input parameters were measured experimentally on lithium manganese oxide electrodes and LiPF6 in 3:7 EC:DMC. Verification and validation for the model is also reported.},

abstract ={The properties of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are determined by the electrochemical and kinetic properties of their constituent materials as well as by their underlying microstructure. In this paper a method is developed that uses microscopic information and constitutive material properties to calculate the response of rechargeable batteries. The method is implemented in OOF, a public domain finite element code, so it can be applied to arbitrary two-dimensional microstructures with crystallographic anisotropy. This methodology can be used as a design tool for creating improved electrode microstructures. Several geometrical two-dimensional arrangements of particles of active material are explored to improve electrode utilization, power density, and reliability of the 
LiyC6|LixMn2O4
battery system. The analysis suggests battery performance could be improved by controlling the transport paths to the back of the positive porous electrode, maximizing the surface area for intercalating lithium ions, and carefully controlling the spatial distribution and particle size of active material. © 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

However, most models do not allow for the fact that the  estimated parameter values have a factor of uncertainty  associated with them - that may originate from non-uniformities  in the material property or the scatter in the experimental  data among other factors.  In the present work, a generalized  procedure to incorporate uncertainty in parameter values based  on the Polynomial Chaos Theory (PCT) is presented. The particle  size inside the carbon electrode of a lithium ion cell is  assumed to have a Gaussian distribution of a known mean and  standard deviation.  The effect of this distributed parameter  value on the discharge curve is illustrated as an example.},
