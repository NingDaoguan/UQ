BUILDING THE CODE

You'll need to build a couple of external package first, prior to building this code
(maybe I'll put the build of these into the main build someday....not today though).

The external stuff is in the "packages" folder in this folder, including lapack and 
cminpack.  Both use CMake to build.  We'll do an out-of-source build, and install 
with "packages" as the install root.

Assume that UQ_DIR is a defined enviroment variable pointing to the folder containing
this file.  LAPACK can be build by doing the following:

cd packages
tar zxf dist/lapack-3.5.0.tgz
mkdir LA_Release
cd LA_Release
cmake -DLAPACKE:BOOL=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${UQ_DIR}/packages -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ../lapack-3.5.0
make -j 4
make test
make install
cd ../..


Similarly, for cminpack

cd packages
tar zxf dist/cminpack-1.3.0.tar.gz
mkdir CM_Release
cd CM_Release
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${UQ_DIR}/packages -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ../cminpack-1.3.0
make -j 4
make test
make install
cd ../..


Finally, ensure that "TOP" is defined in ${UQ_DIR}/GNUmakefile to point to the folder containing 
CCSE's BoxLib and Combustion git repositories, and the type "make" in ${UQ_DIR}.  Also, depending
on your system, the LAPACK lib will install in 

packages/lib, or 
packages/lib64

If the latter, uncomment the line in GNUmakefile that adds the relevant folder to the lib
search path.
