BUILDING THE CODE

(simplified procedure, 1/28/14)

You'll need to build a couple of external package first, prior to building this code
(maybe I'll put the build of these into the main build someday....not today though).

The external stuff is in the "packages" folder in this folder, including lapack and 
cminpack.  Both use CMake to build.  We'll do the build and install using a couple
of scripts that set things up correctly.  

cd packages/dist
./build_lapack
./build_cminpack

Finally, ensure that "TOP" is defined in ${UQ_DIR}/GNUmakefile to point to the folder containing 
CCSE's BoxLib and Combustion git repositories, and then type "make" in ${UQ_DIR}.  Note, depending
on your system, the LAPACK lib will install in packages/lib, or packages/lib64

If the latter, uncomment the line in GNUmakefile that adds the relevant folder to the lib
search path, and then "make".  The build will create a shared library that is built directly
in the "pyemcee" folder, and a .py file that is copied there.

RUNNING THE CODE VIA EMCEE:

On Linux, you'll need to add the library install folders to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${UQ_DIR}/packages/lib:${UQ_DIR}/packages/lib64

For mac and Linux, add the UQ_DIR to PYTHONPATH

        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:${UQ_DIR}

Move to the run folder and run the script:

        python pyemcee/test.py inputs
        python pyemcee/plot.py hist0.dat
        python pyemcee/plot.py hist1.dat
